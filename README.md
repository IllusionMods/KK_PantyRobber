# PluginTemplate
Template for a generic plugin for Illusion games. Replace the readme and code in the src folder to make your own plugin.


This plugin was originally made by picolet21. This codebase is based on v0.2 of his KK_PantyRobber plugin.
He wrote most of it and figured out how to create custom talk scenes. Big respect to him!

I started adding to this plugin because the development seemed to have stopped (no updates in half a year).
My additions include everything in the git history. First commit is the original v0.2 code.
