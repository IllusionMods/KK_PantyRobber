# KK_PantyRobber
A plugin that lets you press a key to steal panties. Precursor to [KK_PantyFairy](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KK_PantyFairy) (do not use both at the same time).

This plugin was originally made by picolet21. This codebase is based on v0.2 of his KK_PantyRobber plugin.
He wrote most of it and figured out how to create custom talk scenes. Big respect to him!

I started working on this plugin because the development seemed to have stopped (no updates in half a year).
My additions include everything in the git history. First commit is the original v0.2 code.
